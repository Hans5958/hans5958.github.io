This repository hosts my website, located at https://hans5958.github.io. Basically, it contains all about me that I wanted show the world. 

I wanted to try to use some modern toys of the current state of web development, while keeping it still simple. With Astro, that is a pipe dream, came true. It is technically still ol' website, with a sprinkle of modern things ans a site generator.

> This is **generation 4** (v4) of the website. If you want to check the previous generation (generation 3 with Jekyll), check out https://github.com/Hans5958/website-jekyll.
